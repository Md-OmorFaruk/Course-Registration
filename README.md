3 Project features :
1.load data in dynamic way.
2.its shows the credit hr and remaining hour.
3.Its shows also the react tost.


Simple Discussion about State :
I used state for many reasons. Firstly I used state for data data, then I used state to maintain remaining credit hours and I also used state to count and drill to total credit hours. It's a powerful hook in React im really enjoyed State Hook to build my course registration project.
