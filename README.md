Simple Discussion about State :
In React, "state" is a JavaScript object that represents the dynamic data within a component. It's used to store and manage information that can change over time and impact how a component is rendered.. Firstly I used state for data data, then I used state to maintain remaining credit hours and I also used state to count and drill to total credit hours. It's a powerful hook in React im really enjoyed State Hook to build my course registration project.
